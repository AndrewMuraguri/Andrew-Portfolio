This portfolio is my first ever autonomous project. My idea of creating this portfolio is to first capsulate all that I have learnt with the Zero To Mastery course on being a WebDeveloper 2023. It is scaleable to multiple devices and is SPA (single page application) through the use of react router. 

Challenges:
+Correct grid formation for scaleabiltiy. 
+Researching on the implementation of a SPA.
+Create use and migration or React Router on my components.
+Adding of a live avatar through video mp4.
+Implementing certain buttons from other devs.
+Setting up the portfolio as a live website.
+Including pdf viewing and docx download for ATS (applicant tracking system). 

Benefits:
+Having fun debugging each road block or creative block.
+Learnt a lot about '@media' and '@fontface'
+Pride in my own creation
+Much stronger command of react/
+Much stronger command of Bootstrap.
+Much stronger command of CSS.

!!UPDATE!!(22.02.2023): Live button for Robofriends will show up blank. Will be resolved shortly. Live button for Portfolio will return 404 error due to how the github pages deployed my website.
